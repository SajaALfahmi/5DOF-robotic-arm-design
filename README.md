# 5DOF-robotic-arm-design

This project contains a 3D model of a robotic arm, designed for educational, experimental, and practical applications. The model is fully modular and features joints and movable parts, making it ideal for 3D printing and robotics projects.

## Project Overview

This robotic arm model is designed to be used with servo motors for movement. The parts are meant to be 3D printed and assembled, and the arm can be controlled with a microcontroller such as an Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

### Key Features
- **Modular and customizable**: The design consists of multiple parts that can be modified or expanded for different applications.
- **Movable joints**: The robotic arm has functional joints that allow it to simulate real arm movements.
- **3D Printable**: All parts are optimized for 3D printing. You can print the components and assemble them easily.

## How to Use

1. **Download the 3D Model Files**  
   Download the STL or CAD files from the repository.

2. **3D Printing**  
   Use a 3D printer to print all parts of the robotic arm. Ensure that you use high-quality filament for durability.

3. **Assembly**  
   Follow the assembly instructions (available in the repository or on the project wiki) to assemble the parts of the robotic arm.

4. **Programming (Optional)**  
   Integrate servo motors to control the arm.  
   Write a program to control the arm's movements using an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi.
