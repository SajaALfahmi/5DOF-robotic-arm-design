# 5DOF-robotic-arm-design

educational, experimental, and practical applications. The design is fully modular, with movable joints, making it ideal for 3D printing and robotics projects.

## Project Overview

The robotic arm is intended to be controlled using servo motors, and assembled with 3D-printed parts. It can be operated via a microcontroller such as an Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

### Key Features
- **Modular and customizable**: The design consists of multiple parts that can be modified or expanded for different applications.
- **Movable joints**: The robotic arm has functional joints that allow it to simulate real arm movements.
- **3D Printable**: All parts are optimized for 3D printing. You can print the components and assemble them easily.

## Getting Started

1. Download the Files
Download the STL or CAD files from the repository.

2. 3D Printing
Print all components using a 3D printer. For best results, use high-quality PLA or ABS filament.

3. Assembly
Assemble the parts according to the assembly guide (check the repository or project wiki).

4. Programming (Optional)
Attach servo motors to the joints.
Use Arduino or Raspberry Pi to control the movement.
Write custom code or use example scripts provided in the repo.
